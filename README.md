## 💡 Project Overview

**Hadith Me** (Arabic: *حدّثني يا رسول الله ﷺ*) is a minimalist single-page website that shows one hadith at a time with its explanation (optional). The interface is calm and focused so users can read and reflect on a short piece of the Prophet’s ﷺ guidance without distractions.

This project is intended for personal / educational use and to encourage frequent, bite-sized engagement with the Sunnah.
